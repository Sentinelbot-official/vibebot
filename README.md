## 🌟 What Makes Vibe Bot Special?

**This isn't your average Discord bot.** Every single feature, every command, every line of code was written **LIVE on a 24/7 Twitch stream** with a global community watching, learning, and contributing ideas in real-time - no matter what timezone!

### 🎭 The Story

On **December 31, 2025**, streamer [Airis](https://twitch.tv/projectdraguk) went live with a challenge: _"Let's build a Discord bot from scratch 24/7 with chat's help!"_

**The stream never stopped.** With viewers from every timezone contributing, what started as 130 basic commands evolved into a **230+ command powerhouse** with:

- 🎵 Full music system (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud)
- 🤖 AI integration (OpenAI & Anthropic)
- 💰 Full economy system with jobs, stocks, and property
- 🎮 15+ mini-games built with chat
- 🛡️ AI-powered auto-moderation
- 👥 Social features (marriage, clans, profiles)
- 🎨 Image generation and manipulation
- 📊 Advanced analytics and insights

**Every feature was suggested, debated, coded, and tested with viewers from around the world, 24/7.** That's what makes this bot unique - it's built BY a global community, FOR the community, around the clock!
